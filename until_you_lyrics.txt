 Georgia, wrap me up in all you have wanted In my arms, oh, let me hold you
 I'll never let you go again like I did or used to say
 I would never fall in love again until I found her
 I said I would never fall unless it's you I fall into
 I was lost within the darkness but then I found her, I found you
 Georgia, pulled me in, I asked to love her
 Once again you fell, I caught ya
 I'll never let you go again like I did or used to say
 I would never fall in love again until I found her
 I said I would never fall unless it's you I fall into
 I was lost within the darkness but then I found her, I found you
 I would never fall in love again until I found her
 I said I would never fall unless it's you I fall into
 I was lost within the darkness but then I found her, I found you
