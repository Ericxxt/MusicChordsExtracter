  "melody_analysis": "The melody exhibits consistent major mode qualities with frequent prominence of the note F, confirming the key center. Phrases generally end on strong tonic or dominant chords, which supports the lyrical content and emotional progression.",
  "patterns": [
    "The recurring chord pattern of A#-F-D#-Gm is used throughout the piece, interspersed with motif variations and lyrical progression.",
    "Observers can note a repetition in the chorus lyrics mirrored by the repetition of chord progressions, echoing the thematic sentiment of rediscovery and steadfast presence in the larger structure of the song."
